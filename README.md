  ## Description

  This application is designed to allow the user to be able to generate a professional README for their own projects and applications.  This application was created with Javascript and powered by Node.js, and collects the user's input through various questions about the project in order to accomplish this task.  While this was for a school project, this is a handy application to have, as coders tend to constantly create a multitude of programs and applications that will all need their own README.  This application will be able to make that quick and painless for the user.

  ## Installation

  The user will first need to clone the repository from GitHub (link is in the "Description" section).  Once done the user will then need to install the npm "Inquirer".  This can be done by typing into the command line "npm install inquirer" once you are in the program folder.  This will download Inquirer, along with all of it's dependencies.  Once done, you should be able to get started with using the program.

  ## Usage

  In order to use the program, the user will need to type "node index.js" in the command line.  Once done, the program will begin with a "Welcome!" followed by a question asking the user for the application's title.  After that, a series of more questions will be asked of the user, either by manually entering what they would like to include, or selecting from a list.  After all questions have been answered, a "Success!" message should appear, signalling to the user that their README has been created.  The user will be able to find their newly constructed README in the program folder, filled with all of the info that they input.  This will range from: Description, Installation, Usage, License, Tests, and Questions.
